# Developing against the Home Assistant container

When you want to check the impact of developing work, e.g. adjusting devices in [zigbee-herdsman-converters](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee-herdsman-converters), you need access to the add-on container in Home Assistant. Here's how:

üö® Following these directions will make your Home Assistant system more prone to misconfiguration (by yourself) to the extent of rendering it completely useless, so only touch what you're confident to and "know what you do". 

1. install the [Portainer addon](https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-portainer) from the Add-on store
2. Make sure to disable its `Protection mode`:

3. Start Portainer and `Open Web UI`
4. in the left menu,
    1. head to `Settings` > section *Hidden Containers* and remove `io.hass.type`: `addon`
    2. go to `Containers`, `addon_[‚Ä¶]_zigbee2mqtt`, `Console`, `Connect`
5. ‚ÑπÔ∏è the location of zigbee-herdsman-converters for example is `/app/node_modules/zigbee-herdsman-converters`
6. make your adjustments by copying or `vi`'ing
7. Still in portainer, go back to the add-on's container and `Restart`

‚ö†Ô∏è Note that restarting the add-on via Supervisor or further down the stack will revert the file changes.

After work is done, don't forget to clean up and reintroduce the safety measures:
1. re-add the filter `io.hass.type`: `addon` for *Hidden Containers*
2. re-activate the "Protection mode" of the Portainer
